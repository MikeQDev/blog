After 5 years of ClickOps in our vendors APM tool, we've finally broke the mold

In January 2024 I joined a brand new platform team that had a focus on SRE. After brainstorming a few potential projects to tackle, our team and management unanimously decided that improving our organization's APM practice was a top priority. This decision was made based on the disheartening amount of production downtime and missed performance OKRs, especially for "tier-1 services" (this company is in the insurance industry, BTW)

Most of the organization's production incidents were brought to our attention through customer complaints. It was clear that engineering teams needed to be empowered with a more proactive monitoring and alerting approach

<!-- These operational flaws stemmed primarily from a couple of things -- complex bugs in the code, poor observability standards and practices (the next item on our teams roadmap), and uncommunicated changes with dependencies. But there's a deeper issue: almost each time an incident was identified, it was due to customer complaints -->

# The existing configuration process

## ClickOps

We have two environments for our APM backend: NONPROD and PROD

If a product team needed monitoring and alerts configured for their service, they'd have two options:

1. Submit a ticket for a performance engineer to manually configure their alert
1. Request temporary 24-hour admin access

In addition to ticketing systems not scaling great, security concerns of handing out admin access, and human error that the above approaches introduced, there's also lack of consistency across environments as well as reusability across services

Each time a team needed their service configured, similar ClickOps would occur, often with slight variations (intentional or not). What made me squirm even more was comparing a service's NONPROD to PROD configurations and seeing numerous inconsistencies between the environments

## Maturing slightly: API calls

If life gave clever engineers 24-hour admin access to a toilsome process/tool, they'd generate non-expiring admin API tokens. *Hypothetically speaking.*

A couple of folks had *consentually* obtained API tokens from the tooling owners and created private Postman collections they created on the side of their desks. This allowed these users to easily configure the APM backend by changing a few variables then pressing the "Send" button to emit the API request

This kind of worked, but fell short in a couple of areas (list not exhaustive):

1. No guardrails, governance, or rollback process
1. Maintaining a bunch of Postman collections for each configuration was tedious
1. No state management or API request idempotency
1. Not self-service for engineering teams
1. Could not be publicized/offered as a service within the company

In a sense, this felt like a form of shadow IT, ran by a limited number of clever users with a privileged API token

We could do better

# Pushing for change

Our team designed a modernized approach for managing our APM solution using two flows:

## Decentralized, "engineer enablement"

The objective was to enable engineers to self-service their APM configurations with as little intervention as possible

This entailed offering limited-privilege API tokens that would be shared at the organization level (for simplicity. Sharing the token at team or service level was also an option, but rolling out an initial solution was higher priority). 

## Centralized, "admin enablement"


"Build an API"
  On a 2-week vacation during this
"Use the vendors YAML config tool"
"Emotional" struggles


 they'd perform a handful of steps:

1. Firewall request
1. Ticket request to configure monitoring backend tol 

NONPROD then PROD. Inconsistencies

Not even "what good looks like"

# The push(back) for change

# The new process

## The ideal approach

## Challenges
Can't use TFE VCS due to audit reasons

2 environments: NONPROD and PROD
  What about staging?

Secrets management

Terraform modules: to offer or not?

Code reviews

## The actual approach

## Rollout

- Documentation/README
- Dog fooding with junior engineers
- Pilot teams

# Concerns
- Locked in deeper with vendor
- Poor vendor IAM, blast radius
