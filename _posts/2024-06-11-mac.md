After 5 years of ClickOps in our vendors APM tool, we've finally broke the mold

In January 2024 I joined a brand new platform team that had a focus on SRE. After brainstorming a few potential projects to tackle, our team and management unanimously decided that improving our APM practices was a top priority. This decision was made based on the disheartening amount of production downtime and missed performance OKRs, especially for "tier-1 services" (this company is in the insurance industry, BTW). Most of the organization's production incidents were brought to our attention through customer complaints, so it was clear that teams needed a more proactive monitoring and alerting approach

<!-- These operational flaws stemmed primarily from a couple of things -- complex bugs in the code, poor observability standards and practices (the next item on our teams roadmap), and uncommunicated changes with dependencies. But there's a deeper issue: almost each time an incident was identified, it was due to customer complaints -->

# The existing configuration process: ClickOps
NONPROD then PROD. Inconsistencies

Not even "what good looks like"

# The push(back) for change
"Build an API"
  On a 2-week vacation during this
"Use the vendors YAML config tool"
"Emotional" struggles

# The new process

## The ideal approach

## Challenges
Can't use TFE VCS due to audit reasons

2 environments: NONPROD and PROD
  What about staging?

Secrets management

Terraform modules: to offer or not?

Code reviews

## The actual approach

## Rollout

- Documentation/README
- Dog fooding with junior engineers
- Pilot teams

# Concerns
- Locked in deeper with vendor
- Poor vendor IAM, blast radius
